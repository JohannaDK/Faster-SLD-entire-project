## Depth-Anything Depth Estimation Script (README)

This script demonstrates how to use a pre-trained depth estimation model from the Transformers library to predict depth maps from RGB images.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* `numpy` library
* `Pillow (PIL Fork)` library
* `transformers` library
* `matplotlib` library
* `OpenCV (cv2)` library

**Instructions:**

1. **Install required libraries:** Use `pip install <library_name>` for each library (e.g., `pip install numpy`).
2. **Download a pre-trained depth estimation model:** You can find models on the Hugging Face Model Hub (search for "depth estimation"). Replace `model_path` in the script with the downloaded model's location.
3. **Run the script:** Execute the script using `python depth_estimation.py`. This will load the model, predict the depth map for an image (`ethimage.jpeg`), and display both the original image and the predicted depth map. It will also save the depth map as `depth_map.jpeg`.

**Notes:**

* The script assumes the image and model path variables (`image_path` and `model_path`) are set correctly. Modify them to your specific locations.
* This is a basic example. You can explore the `transformers` library for more advanced usage and customization options.

**Additional Information:**

* The script performs some post-processing steps on the predicted depth map, including normalization and Gaussian blurring. You can adjust these steps as needed.
